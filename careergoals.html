            <h2>Short-Term Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Currently, I have a short-term goal to get into the IT and cybersecurity field through an internship
                or an entry-level position. I want to gain experience with networking and
                security. I am currently studying for the Cisco CCNA and building personal projects that strengthen my programming,
                security, and analytical abilities. I am currently studying for a 
                Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and I am aiming to graduate early.

            <h2>Long-Term Career Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Long-term, I plan to become a Security Engineer or a Network Engineer.
                My goal is to gain experience over time and expand my knowledge.
                I want to continue my learning and keep growing as an individual.
                That may look like getting more certifications or pursuing a Master's degree.
